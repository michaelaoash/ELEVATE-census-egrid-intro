\begin{questions}

  \question Visit the Air Toxics at School interactive tool. Request a report on a school that you have attended. What are the Top 5 chemicals by risk from industrial point source releases (US EPA Toxics Release Inventory)? What facilities are the sources for these releases?  Where does the school rank among schools in the same state and among all schools in U.S.?  Is it easy or possible to ascertain an absolute risk level, for example, increase in cancer risk at the school location?

  \question Visit the Top 100 Polluter Indexes.  Find a publicly traded company that appears on the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index, the Toxic 100 Water Polluters Index, the Greenhouse 100 Index, and the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index. Find a privately held company that appears on the Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index, the Toxic 100 Water Polluters Index, the Greenhouse 100 Index, and the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index.

  \question Visit the Toxic 100 Air Polluters listing for two oil companies.  For each company, find a facility that has both a high Toxic Score and a high EJ: Minority Share.  (What does Toxic Score measure?  What does EJ: Minority Share measure?)

    
  \question What is the difference between the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index and the Greenhouse 100 Index?  What type of company dominates the top of the Greenhouse Suppliers 100 Index?  What type of company dominates the top of the Greenhouse 100 Index?

  \question Visit the Coal Producers \& Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index.  Identify a coal producer that interests you from the standpoint of just transition. 

  \question Which of the 100 lists shows the highest \emph{disproportionality} (the highest share of the total for all 100 accounted for by the top 2, 5, or 10 facilities)?
    
  \question Visit the website for the ``historical'' eGRID data \url{https://www.epa.gov/egrid/historical-egrid-data}.  We will use the 2020 data because supplemental data on Particulate Matter releases (\url{https://www.epa.gov/egrid/egrid-related-materials}) are also available for 2020 (but not yet for 2021).  Download the metric and non-metric Excel data.  Also download the eGRID PM2.5 Data.  (The downloads are already included in the GitHub repository, and you can skip the download step if you have already downloaded the repository.) Open the spreadsheets in Excel or another spreadsheet program but do not modify the data in any way.

    \begin{parts}
    \part eGRID integrates data on electrical-generation facilities US DOE Energy Information Administration and the US EPA Clean Air Markets Division.  What is the difference between the Unit, Generator, and Plant sheets? (We will focus on the Plant sheet.)  
    \part What variables are available on each plant?  Review some of the columns on the Plant sheet of the eGRID workbook.  Find several columns that concern location and management.  Find several columns that concern electricity generation.  Find several columns that concern pollutant emissions.
    \end{parts}

    
  \question Make sure that the script files and the egrid spreadsheets are in the same directory. In the same directory are several files from the  Air Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy analysis (APEEP) model developed by Nick Muller at Carnegie Mellon and others  \url{https://public.tepper.cmu.edu/nmuller/APModel.aspx}. These files compute monetized estimates (\$/ton) of the damage to human health, agriculture, and physical capital per ton of emissions based on the county of \emph{release}.

  \question  Open the script file \texttt{egrid2020\_metric.R} or \texttt{egrid2020\_nonmetric.R} (your choice) in Rstudio or another IDE for R.  Work through the script one line at a time, carefully reviewing inputs and outputs.   Find, run and review the output of the summarize routine that computes shares of capacity, generation, and emissions by fuel. 

  \question Find the routine that looks for generation that may be associated with universities. Modify the search terms to see if you can find additional university-based facilities.
    
  \question At the end of the program we focus on Massachusetts facilities and save a dataset of fossil-fuel facilities in Massachusetts.

    
  \question In the \texttt{tidycensus-demo/holyoke-poverty} directory of the GitHub repository, open the R script file \texttt{holyoke-poverty.R}.  This file demonstrates the use of the \texttt{tidycensus} package in R.  Please go to the link and get your own Census API key and replace mine with yours.

    
  \question We will use the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data (pooling survey results from 2016--2020, which permits analysis of small areas such as Census Tracts and Census Block Groups.  The ACS is a household survey that asks questions about demographics and income.  We will focus on the determination of poverty based on household composition and income and compute poverty rates for families with children for Census Block Groups (similar to neighborhoods) in Holyoke.

    
  \question First we find the relevant variables.  Then we use \texttt{tidycensus} to download the count variables directly from the ACS website at the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and we compute the poverty rate from the poverty counts. It is always helpful to look at the data at intermediate steps.  Geographic data which enables map plotting is included with the economic and demographic variables. 

  \question How big are Block Groups?  If you have been to Holyoke, look at the map of Holyoke with Block Groups indicated.  How long would it take you to walk across a downtown Block Group?  Is there variation in the size of Block Groups?  How many households are there in some of the Block Groups of Holyoke?

    
  \question Look at the coding of the Census geography. The GEOID for a Block Group is a 15 character string:  \texttt{SSCCCTTTTTTB}. This looks daunting but it can be easily parsed to show the geography:\\
    \begin{tabular}{cp{0.8\textwidth}}
      \texttt{SS}  & Two-digit code for the state in more or less alphabetical order. Massachusetts is 25. \\
      \texttt{CCC} & Three-digit code for the county within the state (usually only odd numbers).  Hampden County is 013. \\
      \texttt{TTTT.TT} & Six-digit code to identify the tract within the county.  The . is not shown, but the first four digits are usually sufficient to identify the tract and the last two digits are often 00. Sometimes an additional two digits, e.g., .01 and .02, are added, especially if a Tract splits over time. Tracts are selected to have between 1,200 and 8,000 people with a target population of 4,000.\\
      \texttt{B} & One-digit code to identify the block group with the tract. There are typically 1--4 block groups in a tract.
    \end{tabular}\\
    While counties are a political jurisdiction (although not much of one in Massachusetts), Census Tracts and Block Groups are not jurisdictions and they may even cross the lines of municipalities.  Tracts and Block Groups are typically selected to conform to physical boundaries (rivers, large roads, etc.) and social boundaries (roughly corresponding to ``neighborhoods''), but there is variation over time and space.  Block Groups partition Tracts which partition Counties which partition States, but the connection to other relevant geographies (wards and precincts, Congressional and other legislative districts, School districts, Zip codes, municipalities, etc.) is tenuous.  These other geographies are often available (from the Census or other public and private sources), and they can sliced up to match Census geography but the process is somewhat more complicated.

    
  \question We also use several TIGER/Line files to decorate the map with water, some large streets and roads, and voting wards.  These were separately downloaded from the Census.

  \question The script culminates with a poverty-rate choropleth of the Block Groups of Holyoke.

    
  \question A coda returns to the eGRID data, converts the latitudes and longitudes in the Massachusetts fossil fuel electrical generation data, plots a map of the generators within the cities and towns of Massachusetts, and then computes the distance between each generation facility and each ward (voting district) of Holyoke. 

  \question Find a fossil-fuel EGU that is within Holyoke.  What ward is it in? What was
    its primary fuel, and how much energy did generate in 2020?  Find
    the next closes fossil-fuel EGU and report on it.
